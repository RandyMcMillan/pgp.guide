EverDesk is the first and only email client which stores email messages as individual files together with your other files and documents in regular Windows folders, so you can keep all the information related to the same subject together and work with it in a simpler, more flexible, and more powerful way. It can send PGP-encrypted messages using a quick and easy 'Lock' button in Compose window.
