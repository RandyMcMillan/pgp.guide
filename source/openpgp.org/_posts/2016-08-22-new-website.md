Welcome to our new website.
I took over the maintenance of openpgp.org and created new webpages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).
The images are licensed under CC0 and were obtained from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com).

The website is hosted on GitHub and I encourage all visitors to participate in creating and improving content of this website to make it the new main source of information related to the OpenPGP standard.
We are open for [pull requests](http://github.com/OpenPGP/openpgp.github.io).
