The German Unix User Group (GUUG) is pleased to announce the first public conference on the OpenPGP protocol taking place in Cologne, Germany on September 8+9, 2016.

OpenPGP.conf is a conference for users and implementers of the OpenPGP protocol, the popular standard for encrypted email communication and protection of data at rest.
That protocol is the foundation of encryption software like PGP, GnuPG, Mailvelope, OpenKeyChain, and others.

OpenPGP.conf is a place to meet, discuss, and learn about latest developments of OpenPGP aware applications and what technical measures can be deployed to repel the ever increasing trend to mass surveillance.

Topics are:

  - The OpenPGP protocol and its planned revision
  - Current status of OpenPGP applications
  - Interesting use cases
  - Key discovery and distribution
  - Ubiquitous end-to-end encryption
  - Security analysis
  - User interface studies
  - Anonymous mail and the spam problem
